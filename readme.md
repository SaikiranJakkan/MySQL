MySQL databases are relational.
MySQL software is Open Source.
The MySQL Database Server is very fast, reliable, scalable, and easy to use.
## Query data
This section helps you learn how to query data from the MySQL database server. We will start with a simple SELECT statement that allows you to query data from a single table.

SELECT – show you how to use simple SELECT statement to query the data from a single table.
## Sorting data
ORDER BY – show you how to sort the result set using ORDER BY clause. The custom sort order with the FIELD function will be also covered.
## Filtering data
WHERE – learn how to use the WHERE clause to filter rows based on specified conditions.
AND – introduce you to the AND operator to combine Boolean expressions to form a complex condition for filtering data.
OR– introduce you to the OR operator and show you how to combine the OR operator with the AND operator to filter data.
IN – show you how to use the IN operator in the WHERE clause to determine if a value matches any value in a list or a subquery.
BETWEEN – show you how to query data based on a range using BETWEEN operator.
LIKE  – provide you with technique to query data based on a specific pattern.
LIMIT – use LIMIT to constrain the number of rows returned by SELECT statement
## Joining tables
Table & Column Aliases – introduce you to table and column aliases.
Joins  – give you an overview of joins supported in MySQL including inner join, left join, and right join.
INNER JOIN – query rows from a table that has matching rows in another table.
LEFT JOIN – return all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table or null if no matching rows found in the right table.
RIGHT JOIN – return all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table or null if no matching rows found in the left table.
CROSS JOIN – make a Cartesian product of rows from multiple tables.
## Grouping data
GROUP BY – show you how to group rows into groups based on columns or expressions.
HAVING – filter the groups by a specific condition.
## Modifying data in MySQL
NSERT – use various forms of the INSERT statement to insert data into a table.
INSERT INTO SELECT – insert data into a table from the result set of a query.
INSERT IGNORE  – explain you the INSERT IGNORE statement that inserts rows into a table and ignore rows that cause errors.
UPDATE – learn how to use UPDATE statement and its options to update data in database tables.
UPDATE JOIN – show you how to perform cross table update using UPDATE JOIN statement with INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN.
DELETE – show you how to use the DELETE statement to delete rows from one or more tables.
ON DELETE CASCADE – learn how to use ON DELETE CASCADE referential action for a foreign key to delete data from a child table automatically when you delete data from a parent table.
DELETE JOIN – show you how to delete data from multiple tables.
REPLACE – learn how to insert or update data depends on whether data exists in the table or not.
